*Edgar Wright revealed that since 2010, there has been an email group that the entire cast and crew of the film version has been a part of. The making of the film was considered such a great experience by everyone involved that the email group never disbanded just so everyone could keep in touch. When it was time to cast for this series, rather than go to everyone's agents, Edgar Wright went onto the same email group to ask if anyone would like to reprise their roles. Every single cast member jumped at the chance to play their character again, all of them replying within only three hours*
